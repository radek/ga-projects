**Overall:**
Great work on this assignment! I don't have any notes for now, but I will have more once we get into some of the later assignments. Given you are plenty comfortable with Python and some basic analysis, I highly encourage you to dive into some basic ML math if you haven't already! In this homework we will be using a logistic regression, but I encourage you to try out some other models as well!

***Please let me know if you have any questions on any topics at all! I am here to answer and help.***
