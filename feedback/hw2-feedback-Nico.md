**Overall:**  
Great work on this assignment! You made great use of various pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn functionality. The only direct advice that I have is to keep on practicing and take note of some of the 'tricks' and best practices that you see in class.

**Some notes**  
* In *Question 13*, though I am sure you are a bit familiar given our most recent classes on classification, note that you would not use an OLS for this problem. You would want to use some form of classification model to solve this supervised learning task.
